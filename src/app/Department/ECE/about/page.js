      The Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at the National Institute of
      Technology Patna began its journey in 1978 with just 10 undergraduate students. The department is
      dedicated to providing quality education at both undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate levels.
    </p>

    <p>Currently, it offers the following programs:</p>

    <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>B.Tech</strong> in "Electronics & Communication Engineering" with an intake of 161.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dual degree (B.Tech + M.Tech)</strong> in "Microelectronics and VLSI System Design" with an intake of 22.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>M.Tech in:</strong>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-1">
          <li>"Next Generation Wireless Technologies" with an intake of 15.</li>
          <li>"Microelectronics and VLSI System Design" with an intake of 15.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ph.D.</strong> (Full-time and Part-time) in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      All courses are regularly updated by academic and industry experts to meet the needs of today&apos;s
      industry. The undergraduate program is accredited by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) for
      six years, from July 2021 to June 2027. The department received a grant of â‚¹3.52 Crore from DST under the FIST scheme for upgrading the Antenna Engineering Laboratory.
      The VLSI Lab has also been upgraded with the support of the SMDP-C2SD project.
    </p>

    <p>The department has a group of young, competent, and dedicated faculty members engaged in quality research in the following areas:</p>

    <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-2">
      <li>High Power RF / Microwave Devices, Antennas, Filters, Metamaterials and Metasurfaces, Microwave Imaging, Computational Electromagnetics.</li>
      <li>Signal Processing, Image Processing, Speech Analysis, Biomedical Signal Processing, Machine Learning, Soft Computing Techniques, Pattern Recognition.</li>
      <li>Analog, Digital and Mixed Signal IC Design, FPGA-based System Design, Synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials, Nano-electronics.</li>
      <li>Wireless Communications and Networks, Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms, Physical Layer, Cognitive Radio Network (CRN), Optical Fiber Communication.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We continually engage in exploring promising research areas to prepare our students to lead in their
      respective fields, making impactful contributions in their professional life.
